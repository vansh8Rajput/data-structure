Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","Ans.There are mainly only two to three reason why we need to use set instead of a list in python.\n","\n","a.1You want to remove duplicates\n","Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values.\n","Ex:\n","my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n","my_set = set(my_list)\n","print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}\n","\n","b.

What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","Ans.A string is a sequence of characters used to store text.\n","string is created in single' of double\" quotes.\n","\n","a:the main and bigest difference between list and string is that list is muttable and string is immutabale.\n","\n","b:we can change value of the list after creation.\n","but,in the string is not posible becouse string is immmurtable.\n","\n","c:string data structure only can store string datatype.becouse it is Heterogeneous datatype.\n","Ex:name=\"vansh\"\n","\n","But,in the list datastructure we can store multiple datatype.becouse it is Homogeneous datatype,\n","Ex:list=[1,2,3,4,\"hello\",True]\n","\n","d:now here is something that is possible in both string and the list.Can be looped, sliced, indexed .\n","\n","Q7 How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","Ans:Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their values cannot be changed.\n","\n","This immutability ensures that the data stays safe and unchanged, which is perfect when you want to:\n","\n","a:Protect values from accidental changes\n","b:Use data as a constant\n","c:Use as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets (because they are hashable)\n","\n","Q8 What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","Ans: Hash table is used to store the value in key-value pair.\n","we can access the value useing the key inside hash table.\n","It uses a hash function to convert each key into a unique index, where the corresponding value is stored in memory.\n","In Python, the dictionary (dict) is implemented using a hash table. This design makes accessing, adding, and removing values by key extremely fast. — usually in O(1) time.\n","for example:\n","# dictionary using a hash table\n","student = {'name': 'Vansh', 'age': 21, 'grade': 'A'}\n","# Accessing a value\n","print(student['name'])  # Output: Vansh\n","\n","Q9 Can lists contain different data types in Python.\n","Ans:yes,list can contain diffrent dataypes in python.\n","list=[1,2.3,True,\"hello\",3+4j]\n","print(list)\n","\n","Q10 Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n","Ans:string are immutable in pyhton means the value can be changed after creation.\n","If strings were mutable, changing one would change all references to it. That would break things.\n","\n","Q11 What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","Ans:Dictionaries are more efficient and easier to work with when:\n","a.You need quick access using unique keys\n","b.Data has labels or identifiers\n","c.You're managing structured or nested information.\n","\n","example of list:\n","student_list = ['Vansh', 21, 'A']\n","#we need to rember the position\n","print(student_list[0])  \n","\n","example for dictionary:\n","student_dict = {'name': 'Vansh', 'age': 21, 'grade': 'A'}\n","#we can access the value just useing the key.\n","print(student_dict['name'])  \n","\n","Q12 Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","Ans:Tuple is immutable(means value can not be changed after creating it ) and list is mutable(means value can be changed after creation).\n","\n","tuple and list both can store multiple datatype.but,we use tuple when we need constant value for our code.becouse the values can not ne changed after creation\n","\n","tuple is immutable so,we also can use tuple as the dictionary key.\n","\n","Ex:\n","tuple=(1,2,3,\"hello\")\n","\n","value can be used ad dictionay's key\n","dict={(\"hello\",\"world\"):\"veon\"}\n","\n","Q13 How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","Ans: sets not print dublicates value means they remove dublicate value. when we give instruction to print set.\n","\n","Sets in Python do not allow duplicates. They are useful when you want to automatically filter out repeated items and work with unique values only.\n","\n","sets is a unordered collection of data.\n","\n","Q14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","Ans:\"in\" keyword is type of the membership operator.\n","\n","In list in keyword is used to check the element is present inside the list or not .\n","we provide element in the code if we want to check it is inside the list or not.\n","It check each element one by one(linear search)\n","for example:\n","list=[1,2,33,4,\"hello\"]\n","if 2 in list:\n","  print(\"yes\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"no\")\n","\n","But ,in the list it checks if the key exists in the dictionary — not the value.\n","i.e:if we give or provide key in code it check it ,but if we give value it not check fot it,if value is inside the code or not inside the code.\n","for example:\n","dictionary={'name': 'Bob', 'age': 22, 'city': 'New York'}\n","if 'name' in dictionary:\n","  print(\"yes\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"no\").\n","\n","Q15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n","Ans:NO, we can not modify the elements of a tuple.\n","becouse tuple is immutable in the pyhton means we can not change the value of a tuple after creating it.\n","Ex:\n","tuple=(1,2,3,4,\"hello\")\n","tuple[0]=\"vansh\"\n","print(tuple) if we try to do that it will through an error.\n","\n","Q16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","Ans:A nested dictionary in Python is a dictionary inside another dictionary.\n","This structure allows you to store multiple levels of related data in a clear and organized way.\n","For example:\n","students = {\n","    '101': {'name': 'Vansh', 'age': 21, 'grade': 'A'},\n","    '102': {'name': 'Aryan', 'age': 22, 'grade': 'B'}\n","}\n","print(students['101']['name'])  #output: Vansh\n","print(students['102']['grade']) #Output: B\n","\n","Q17: Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n","Ans:In Python, dictionaries are built using a hash table.\n","This allows for efficient key-based access to values. When you access a value using a key, Python uses a hash function to find the exact memory location of that value.\n","for example:\n","student = {'name': 'Vansh', 'age': 21, 'grade': 'A'}\n","# print(student['name'])  # Output: Vansh → Time: O(1).\n","\n","Q18: In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries.\n","Ans:Lists are preferred over dictionaries when you need to store a collection of ordered items where position(index 0,1)matters.\n","\n","list allows dublicte elements but in the dictionary we store diffrent values in same key then,dictionary preffer the value which is defined in the last.\n","\n","in list like dictionary you don't need to associate items with specific labels (keys).\n","\n","ex:\n","list=[1,2,3,4,\"hello\"]\n","print(list[3])\n","\n","dictionary={'name': 'Vansh', 'age': 21}\n","print(dictionary['name'])\n","\n","Q19: Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","Ans:dictionary:\n","A dictionary is an unordered collection of data which store data in the format of key-value pairs.\n","Data is retrieved using keys, not positions(index like 0 , 1) like a list.\n","Keys are unique and act like index but it is not the index.\n","for example:\n","student = {'name': 'Vansh', 'age': 21}\n","print(student['name'])\n","\n","Q20: Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","Ans:List:\n","A list is an ordered collection of elements.\n","Data is retrieved using index numbers (starting from 0).\n","Index-based retrieval requires knowing the position of the item.\n","for example:\n","list=[1,2,3,4,\"hello\"]\n","print(list[3])\n","\n","dictionary:\n","A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.\n","Data is retrieved using keys, not positions.\n","Keys are unique and act like index but it is not the index.\n","for example:\n","student = {'name': 'Vansh', 'age': 21}\n","print(student['name'])\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JBvrowcAVV5d"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#practical questions"],"metadata":{"id":"tGu73OguWI9v"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q1.
